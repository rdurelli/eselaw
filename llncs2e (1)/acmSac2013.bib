  abstract = {Many maintenance tasks address concerns, or features, that are not
	well modularized in the source code comprising a system. Existing
	approaches available to help software developers locate and manage
	scattered concerns use a representation based on lines of source
	code, complicating the analysis of the concerns. In this paper, we
	introduce the concern graph representation that abstracts the implementation
	details of a concern and makes explicit the relationships between
	different parts of the concern. The abstraction used in a Concern
	Graph has been designed to allow an obvious and inexpensive mapping
	back to the corresponding source code. To investigate the practical
	tradeoffs related to this approach, we have built the feature exploration
	and analysis tool (FEAT) that allows a developer to manipulate a
	concern representation extracted from a Java system, and to analyze
	the relationships of that concern to the code base. We have used
	this tool to find and describe concerns related to software change
	tasks. We have performed case studies to evaluate the feasibility,
	usability, and scalability of the approach. Our results indicate
	that concern graphs can be used to document a concern for change,
	that developers unfamiliar with concern graphs can use them effectively,
	and that the underlying technology scales to industrial-sized programs.}
