Systematic review studies belong to Evidence-Based Software Engineering (EBSE) paradigm [36]. They provide new, empirical and systematic methods of research. Although several studies have been reported in the broader context of Architecture Driven Modernization (ADM)~\cite{PerezCastillo20121370, SMR:SMR582, FuentesFernandez2012247, PrezCastillo2011519}, to the best of our knowledge any systematic review has been conducted in this field. As for the fact that various types of research have appeared addressing diversifying focus areas related to the topic of modernization of legacy system by means of ADM, we claim the need for a more systematic investigation of this topic. As result, this paper is meant to furnish to ADM through a systematic review and evidence-based approach. Also we argue that this paper may help researchers in the field of modernization of legacy systems, once the paper provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art of the ADM. Furthermore, it may serve as a first step towards more thorough examination of the topics addressed in it with the help of systematic literature reviews.
