This study was undertaken as a systematic review based on the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham and Brereton~\cite{Kitchenham} which consist of three main phases: (\textit{i}) planning, (\textit{ii}) conducting and (\textit{iii}) reporting. %In Figure~\ref{process_systematic_review} depicts these three phases that we carried out herein. 
%Furthermore, in this paper we have used Visual Text Mining (VTM) technique to support the studies selection~\cite{Malheiros:2007}. VTM uses text mining algorithms and methods combined with interactive visualisations. Therefore, it can help the user making sense of a collection of primary studies, without actually reading all of them. In this case the studies were reading partially or full. The following sections present details on how each phase was carried out.
